# Learning Management System (LMS)

## Project Overview

Our Learning Management System (LMS) is a web-based platform designed to facilitate educational activities such as course management, student enrollment, assignment submission, and progress tracking. The system will offer role-based access for admins, instructors, and students, with intuitive user interfaces and robust backend services.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login functionality for admins, instructors, and students.
- **Course Management**: Create, manage, and update courses, lessons, and assignments.
- **Assignment Submission**: Students can submit assignments and receive feedback.
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress tracking and performance metrics.
- **Communication**: Forums or messaging between students and instructors.
  
## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js (UI components, routing, state management)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (API endpoints, authentication)
- **Database**: MongoDB (storing user data, course materials, submissions)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: 
    ```
    git clone <repo-url>
    ```
2. Install dependencies: 
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Set up environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection URI, JWT secrets).
4. Run the app:
    - Backend: `npm run server`
    - Frontend: `npm run client`
